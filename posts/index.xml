      <title>Fitting single transits</title>

      <description>Shortly before group meeting, I asked Twitter what I should work on today (see above). But, working on writing the paper is much less fun than thinking about new features so I went through a derivation of the right &amp;ldquo;priors&amp;rdquo; to use when characterizing a single transit. I have previously published on this topic (as have many others!) and the basic idea is that even if you only detect a single transit you can place some constraint on the orbital period because the duration of the transit is informative.</description>

      <title>Finding Anomalies in Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>I have been working on a new method for detecting anomalies in astronomical images with deep learning, with Marc Huertas-Company (Observatoire de Paris) and Alexie Leauthaud (UCSC). The idea is to use unsupervised learning to pick out potentially interesting (or &amp;ldquo;anomalous&amp;rdquo;) objects in galaxy surveys, as there is way too much data to look through by hand; the lack of supervision also means we can find interesting things we may not know to look for.</description>

      <title>The Transition Redshift</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a short reionization project where we want to figure out where a function crosses zero. I&amp;rsquo;ll spare the details of what this function (P21,g) is for the bottom of this post. But suffice it to say that the redshift where it transitions from being positive to negative (the &amp;ldquo;transition redshift&amp;rdquo;) is an interesting quantity. The plot shows a sketch of what the data might look like - where the function itself is not measured but the data still constrai</description>

      <title>Doppler Imaging</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m generally interested in the problem of mapping the surfaces of stars and exoplanets, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve focused so far on doing this using photometric timeseries, for the past couple months I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with spectroscopic data and the idea of Doppler imaging. The basic idea here is to take high resolution spectra of a rapidly rotating star at different rotational phases and look at the distortion of its spectral lines as starspots rotate from the blueshifted hemisphere to the redshifted hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Python Toolkit for Background-Subtracted TESS Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://astrodata.nyc/posts/2019-08-02-tess_cpm/</link>

      <description>Over the summer I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Dan Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg on developing a Python toolkit to obtain background-subtracted TESS lightcurves from the Full-Frame Images (FFI). One of the goals of this project is to detect transient events in the TESS data by doing difference imaging without constructing a reference image. We do that by implementing a method called Causal Pixel Model (CPM) Difference Imaging explained in detail here and here.</description>

      <title>The straight stellar stream in Cen A</title>

      <description>I recently attended the IAU Symposium 355 “The Realm of the Low Surface Brightness Universe”, where I had the chance to get an update on the current observational status of, among other things, detecting streams in external galaxies. Denija Crnojevic showed her map (Crnojevic et al. 2016) of the nearby galaxy, Centaurus A (see left panel of the Figure above). This lead to some discussion on the “straightness” of the stellar stream emerging from the dwarf galaxy referred to as Dw3 in the figure.</description>

      <title>Dust Inference</title>

      <description>I have been working with Andy Miller (Columbia) on building a 3D dust map of the Milky Way galaxy using a Gaussian process prior on 1e9 stars from Gaia. Of course we always want to solve all of astronomy, and infer the dust map and the color magnitude diagram simultaneously. But for a first step we want to model a dust-free CMD, infer individual dust estimates for stars, and then build the GP model on these individual estimates.</description>

      <description>This is the first post for our site and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty meta. This week at group meeting, I presented this blog to the group (pictured above). Our goal is to use this as a way to highlight some of the things that we work on in our group, to give ourselves some amount of accountability, and to practice open and transparent science. After this post, the plan is that each week one group member will post the figure that they presented in group meeting with a short description of what they&amp;rsquo;re working on, what they&amp;rsquo;ve recently learned, and (perhaps) where they&amp;rsquo;re stuck.</description>

      <description>This is our website where one member of the group will post a research update every week. This is meant to be work in progress so keep your expectations set accordingly.
